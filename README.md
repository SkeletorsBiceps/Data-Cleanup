# Overwatch-League-Data-Cleanup
Repository of code I used to clean and organize data from the Overwatch League. I use SQLite and Python as well as some Jupyter notebooks to show my thought process and reasoning as I'm cleaning the data.

The original raw data can be found here: https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab
