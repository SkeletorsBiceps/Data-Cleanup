# Overwatch League Data Projects
This is a repository of code I utilized for personal projects using Overwatch League data.

**Data Cleanup** is SQL code used to clean and organize nearly 5 million rows of Overwatch League data from 14 flat CSV files into a database of 7 connected tables.

**Liquipedia API Web Scrap** is Python code used to scrape data on Overwatch League players from Liquipedia.net and upload the data to my Overwatch League SQL database.

You can see all of the personal projects I've worked on at my website [mtollefsen.gtihub.io](https://mtollefsen.github.io/)
