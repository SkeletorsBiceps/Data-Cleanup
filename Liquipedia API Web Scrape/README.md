# Liquipedia API Web Scrape

Python code that gets information on the players that are in our [Overwatch League dataset](https://github.com/mtollefsen/overwatch-league-data-projects/tree/main/Data%20Cleanup) by sending requests to Liquipedia's API and parsing the HTML. All requests are spaced out by 30 seconds per [Liquipedia's API Terms of Use](https://liquipedia.net/api-terms-of-use).
