    "### Overwatch and the Overwatch League\n",
    "\n",
    "Overwatch is a 6 vs 6 first-person class-based shooter video game with MOBA elements. The Overwatch League (OWL) is to Overwatch what the NFL is to American football. Every year, or season, there are (generally) four stages of matches and then the playoffs at the end of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is one I made by taking all the datasets found on the [Stats Lab page of the Overwatch League website](#https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab) and combining them in SQLite. It includes all player statistics from OWL matches in the 2018 season, OWL's inaugural year.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has 10 variables (columns):\n",
    "- `start_time` - The date and time that the match began.\n",
    "- `match_id` - Unique ID of the match.\n",
    "- `stage` - What stage in the Overwatch League season it is. \n",
    "- `map_type` - The game mode the match was played on (this can be Assault, Control, Hybrid, or Payload).\n",
    "- `map_name` - Name of the map the match was played on.\n",
    "- `player` - Name of the player.\n",
    "- `team` - Name of the team the player was on.\n",
    "- `stat_name` - Name of the statistic that was measured.\n",
    "- `hero` - Name of the hero that was played.\n",
    "- `stat_amount` - The measure of the stat_name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing & Cleaning the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I import some modules as well as my dataset from my SQLite database."

    "`map_type`, `map_name`, `team`, and `hero` make sense to make categorical data. There are a low number of values each variable can take on and itâ€™s reasonable to assume the number of values they can take on in the future won't increase by a lot in a short amount of time (e.g. I don't expect a release of 12 heroes over three months, or for 35 new teams to join the league in between seasons).\n",

Players can fluctuate some as old players leave and new talent joins the league. `stat_name` won't fluctuate as much since it's almost exclusively tied to the number of heroes in the game (a new hero can mean around 10 new stats being added that are unique to that hero) but at 284 unique values I'm not sure how much memory is saved so I'll do a side-by-side comparison of the two dtypes."
